Beautiful is better than ugly.

择美弃丑

Explicit is better than implicit.

显而不隐

Simple is better than complex.

大道至简

Complex is better than complicated.

繁不应涩

Flat is better than nested.

平而不嵌

Sparse is better than dense.

宜稀不稠

Readability counts.

可靠计数

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

殊不破规

Although practicality beats purity.

实用至上

Errors should never pass silently.

过不宜默

Unless explicitly silenced.

知过即改

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

歧义不猜

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

独理而行

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

何艰不易

Now is better than never.

今时不弃

Although never is often better than *right* now.

弃不如行

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

释应简明

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

不简不释
